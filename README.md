# MacGyver

I realised this project for my study then all PR will be refused but you can write an issue if you see a mistake or something else.

In first you must to clone and download the repository.

After that you need to build a virtual environnement and install module in requirements.txt. Use this command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally you can run game.py and enjoy.
